To compile:
	mpic++ main.cpp -o #Name

To run:
	mpirun -n #Number_of_threads ./#Name #Programm`s_atributes

For example:
	mpic++ main.cpp -o a
	mpirun -n 4 ./a -m 400

-m		# To generate by formula
-f		# To read from file
400		# Size of matrix (when -m)
matrix.txt	# File with matrix (when -f)
-n		# To calculate the norm
